# Lindat Clarin Services

Services from the [Lindat Clarin](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/en) project in the Czech Republic. The following services are available:

1. [UDPipe](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/) - a trainable pipeline for tokenization, tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing of CoNLL-U files. 
1. [NameTag](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/nametag/) - an open-source tool for named entity recognition (NER). NameTag identifies proper names in text and classifies them into predefined categories, such as names of persons, locations, organizations, etc.

**Notes**

As of this writing (Oct 2018) UDPipe supports 168 different language models although currently the LAPPS Grid only exposes the English and Czech models.  The other language models will be added in a future update.
